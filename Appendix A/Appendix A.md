# Appendix A

This appendix describes different C# features that we use or are related to topics we use in the book. I cannot cover all C# features in an appendix, but I did my best to pick the most relevant ones.

We are covering the following:

-   [Older C# features covering C# 1 to 8](Older%20C#%20features.md)
-   [What’s new in .NET 5 and C# 9?](NET%205%20and%20C#%209.md)
-   [What’s new in .NET 6 and C# 10?](NET%206%20and%20C#10.md)
-   [What’s new in .NET 7-8 and C# 11-12?](NET%208%20and%20C#%2012.md)
